Here is the modified flow we discussed today with Ashutosh for LDAP flow.

1.	When the user initiates Organizatoin LDAP eKYC, display the registered user email address
       and registered mobile phone number from user management (read only fields) to initiate the LDAP eKYC.
2.	When the user clicks next, the system shall authenticate the user in the following manner:
a.	UI shall pass the registered email & phone number to backend to obtain LDAP user information. 
b.	The backend shall check if the email and mobile number is valid for any user in LDAP database.
    If a valid user is found in LDAP database matching both email and phone number, then send Email and mobile OTP. 
    If the LDAP user is not found then respond with error message indicating eKYC failed.
c.	The UI shall display OTP screen where the user shall enter Email and Mobile OTP.
d.	If both the OTPs match then the user is authenticated for eKYC
3.	Once the user is authenticated, the LDAP information obtained is displayed in UI 
    (Employee ID, Name, Address, Email, Phone) along with consent check box. 
    The user can complete the eKYC (by clicking submit button) only if the consent check box is checked. 
4.	When eKYC is completed, the Account eKYC is created with active eKYC record for the user.
